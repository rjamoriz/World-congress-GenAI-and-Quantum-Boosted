## 🎯 **Use Cases & Examples**

### **Example 1: Beginner Questions**
**User speaks:** *"I'm new to quantum computing. What should I attend?"*

**AI responds:** *"Welcome to the World Congress! For someone new to quantum computing, I recommend starting with our 'Introduction to Quantum Computing' workshop on Day 1 from 9:00 to 12:00. This beginner-level session covers the fundamentals of qubits and quantum gates. You might also enjoy 'Quantum Machine Learning Fundamentals' on Day 2, which bridges quantum concepts with machine learning applications."*

### **Example 2: Business Leader Inquiry**
**User speaks:** *"I'm a CEO. How can AI help my manufacturing company?"*

**AI responds:** *"As a CEO in manufacturing, I recommend attending 'GenAI for Business Applications' on Day 1, which covers practical AI implementations and ROI analysis. The 'AI Ethics and Governance' workshop on Day 3 is crucial for understanding compliance and risk management. You'll also benefit from networking at the Industry Mixer on Day 2 evening to connect with other business leaders implementing AI solutions."*

### **Example 3: Expert Researcher**
**User speaks:** *"I'm researching QAOA algorithms. What's available for experts?"*

**AI responds:** *"Perfect! For QAOA research, you'll want to attend 'Advanced QAOA Algorithms' on Day 1 from 2:00 to 5:00 PM, led by Professor Michael Rodriguez from MIT. This expert-level workshop dives deep into variational algorithms and optimization techniques. I also recommend 'Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems' on Day 3, which explores cutting-edge hybrid architectures."*
