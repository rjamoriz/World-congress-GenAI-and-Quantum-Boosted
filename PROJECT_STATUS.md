   - Create base layout and routing
   - Build request list component

2. **First UI Demo** (High Priority)
   - Dashboard with request cards
   - Copilot qualification interface
   - Basic schedule view
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (Medium Priority)
   - Backend unit tests
   - API integration tests
   - Test data fixtures

4. **Documentation** (Medium Priority)
   - Video walkthrough
   - API usage examples
   - Architecture diagrams

5. **Phase 2 Planning** (Low Priority)
   - Auth implementation design
   - Real Outlook integration
   - D-Wave quantum setup

---

## üìù Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Authentication**: Open API (Phase 2 feature)
2. **Mock Integrations**: Outlook, Salesforce are stubs
3. **No Real Quantum**: Using simulated annealing only
4. **CSV Export**: Using basic CSV instead of Excel
5. **No Email Sending**: Email generation only, not actual sending

### Technical Debt
1. Need comprehensive test coverage
2. Need to optimize database queries
3. Need to add API request validation with Zod
4. Need to implement proper error codes consistently
5. Need to add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
